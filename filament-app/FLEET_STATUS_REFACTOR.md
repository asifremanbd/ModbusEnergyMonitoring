# Fleet Status Gateway Cards Refactor

## Overview
Refactored the Fleet Status gateway cards to display a cleaner, more focused layout with the specific fields requested and improved Online/Offline logic.

## Changes Made

### Dashboard Component (`app/Livewire/Dashboard.php`)
- **Updated `loadGateways()` method**: Completely refactored to show only the requested fields
- **Improved Online/Offline logic**: Now based on recent readings within 5 minutes instead of gateway's internal status
- **Enhanced success rate calculation**: Uses last 24 hours of readings for more accurate metrics
- **Simplified data structure**: Removed sparkline data and unnecessary fields
- **Better field mapping**: Updated to match the new requirements exactly

### Dashboard View (`resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php`)
- **Streamlined card layout**: Removed sparkline charts and complex activity indicators
- **Added gateway icon**: Consistent gateway symbol for all cards
- **Improved information hierarchy**: Clear display of the 6 requested fields
- **Enhanced status display**: Better visual status indicators with colored badges
- **Maintained responsive design**: Same grid layout with cleaner content

## Fields Displayed Per Gateway Card

Each Fleet Status gateway card now shows exactly these fields:

1. **Icon** - Gateway antenna icon (antenna.png)
2. **Gateway Name** - Name of the gateway
3. **IP Address & Port** - Combined display (e.g., "192.168.1.1:502")
4. **Connected Devices Count** - Number of enabled data points on the gateway
5. **Success Ratio (%)** - Success rate percentage with color coding:
   - Green: â‰¥95%
   - Yellow: 80-94%
   - Red: <80%
6. **Last Seen / Updated Time** - Human-readable time (e.g., "2 minutes ago")
7. **Status** - Online/Offline badge with colored indicator

## Online/Offline Logic
- **Online**: Gateway has readings from any of its data points within the last 5 minutes
- **Offline**: No readings from any data points within the last 5 minutes

This logic is more accurate than the previous gateway-level status as it's based on actual data flow.

## Visual Improvements
- **Antenna gateway icons**: All cards show the antenna.png icon for easy gateway identification
- **Clean layout**: Removed sparkline charts for a cleaner, more focused view
- **Better status indicators**: Clear Online/Offline badges with colored dots
- **Improved spacing**: Better visual hierarchy and readability
- **Color-coded success rates**: Quick visual assessment of gateway performance

## Technical Details
- Maintained the same responsive grid layout (1-4 columns)
- Preserved accessibility features and ARIA labels
- Kept hover effects and keyboard navigation
- Removed sparkline generation for better performance
- Simplified the data loading logic
- Uses Carbon for consistent time formatting

The refactored Fleet Status section now provides a clean, focused view of gateway status with all essential information clearly displayed and accurate Online/Offline detection based on actual data flow.
