# WeeklyMeterCards Widget Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a FilamentPHP StatsOverviewWidget named `WeeklyMeterCards` that displays weekly usage summaries for each meter in the system.

## ✅ Requirements Met

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **One card per meter**: Each enabled DataPoint (meter) gets its own card
- ✅ **7-day usage calculation**: Calculates consumption by subtracting consecutive readings over the last 7 days
- ✅ **Smart unit detection**: Automatically detects kWh for energy meters, m³ for water/gas meters
- ✅ **Sparkline charts**: Shows daily usage trends as small charts on each card
- ✅ **Proper heading**: Widget displays "Weekly Usage (per meter)" as the heading

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ **Filament v3 best practices**: Uses lazy loading, caching, and responsive layout
- ✅ **Performance optimized**: 5-minute caching, efficient queries with eager loading
- ✅ **Consistent styling**: Color-coded usage levels with proper Filament theming
- ✅ **Error handling**: Shows "No Data Available" when no readings are found

5. `WEEKLY_METER_CARDS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
1. `app/Livewire/Dashboard.php` - Added WeeklyMeterCards functionality to existing dashboard
2. `resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php` - Added WeeklyMeterCards section above Recent Events
3. `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` - Restored to use original custom view
4. `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` - Cleaned up navigation

## Widget Features

### Data Processing
- Fetches readings from the last 8 days to ensure complete 7-day coverage
- Groups readings by day and calculates daily consumption
- Handles cumulative meter readings correctly (difference between first and last reading per day)
- Filters for good quality readings only

### Unit Detection
Automatically detects meter types based on DataPoint labels and group names:
- **Energy**: kWh (keywords: energy, kwh, kilowatt, power, electricity)
- **Water**: m³ (keywords: water, m³, cubic, liter, flow)
- **Gas**: m³ (keywords: gas, natural gas, propane)
- **Default**: units

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Low usage (Energy: <50 kWh, Water/Gas: <25 m³)
- **Yellow**: Medium usage (Energy: 50-100 kWh, Water/Gas: 25-50 m³)
- **Red**: High usage (Energy: >100 kWh, Water/Gas: >50 m³)
- **Blue**: Unknown meter type

### Performance Features
- **Caching**: Results cached for 5 minutes
- **Polling**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Efficient queries**: Uses eager loading and filtered queries
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Dashboard Structure

The WeeklyMeterCards have been integrated into your existing dashboard layout:
- **Dashboard** (`/admin`): Your original dashboard with WeeklyMeterCards added above Recent Events
  - KPI tiles (Online Gateways, Poll Success Rate, Average Latency)
  - Fleet Status section
  - **NEW**: Weekly Usage (per meter) section
  - Recent Events section

## Testing

Run the test command to verify functionality:
```bash
php artisan test:weekly-meter-cards
```

The test confirms:
- Widget instantiation works correctly
- Data point detection functions properly
- Stat generation handles empty data gracefully

## Usage

The widget automatically appears on the main Dashboard page. It will:
1. Show one card per enabled DataPoint (meter)
2. Display weekly consumption with appropriate units
3. Show daily usage sparklines when data is available
4. Provide average daily consumption and gateway information
5. Use color coding to indicate usage levels

## Next Steps

To populate the widget with data:
1. Ensure DataPoints are properly configured and enabled
2. Verify readings are being collected with good quality
3. Check that readings have proper timestamps within the last 7 days
4. Monitor the widget updates every 30 seconds

The widget is production-ready and follows Filament v3 best practices for performance and user experience.
