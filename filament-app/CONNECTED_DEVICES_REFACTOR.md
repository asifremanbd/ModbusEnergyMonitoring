# Connected Devices Cards Refactor

## Overview
Refactored the Connected Devices cards to show a cleaner, more focused layout with only the essential information requested.

## Changes Made

### Dashboard Component (`app/Livewire/Dashboard.php`)
- **Simplified device status logic**: Now only shows "Online" or "Offline" status based on recent data (within 5 minutes)
- **Updated data structure**: Removed unnecessary fields and focused on the requested information
- **Improved data points counting**: Now counts total data points for the gateway instead of individual readings
- **Cleaner field mapping**: Updated field names to match the new requirements

### Dashboard View (`resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php`)
- **Streamlined card layout**: Removed complex control sections and activity indicators
- **Focused information display**: Shows only the requested fields per card
- **Improved visual hierarchy**: Better spacing and typography for readability
- **Consistent status indicators**: Clear Online/Offline badges with color coding

## Fields Displayed Per Card

Each Connected Device card now shows exactly these fields:

1. **Icon** - Device type icon (by device type/load category)
2. **Status** - Online/Offline with colored badge and dot indicator
3. **Device Name** - Display label of the device
4. **Connected Gateway** - Name of the gateway the device is connected to
5. **Device Type** - Type of device (Energy Meter, Water Meter, etc.)
6. **No. of Data Points** - Total count of enabled data points for the gateway
7. **Success Ratio (%)** - Success rate percentage with color coding:
   - Green: â‰¥95%
   - Yellow: 80-94%
   - Red: <80%
8. **Last Updated Time** - Human-readable time since last update (e.g., "2 minutes ago")

## Status Logic
- **Online**: Device has readings within the last 5 minutes
- **Offline**: No readings within the last 5 minutes

## Visual Improvements
- Clean card layout with consistent spacing
- Device icons prominently displayed in the top-right corner
- Status badges with colored dots for quick visual identification
- Proper color coding for success ratios
- Responsive grid layout maintained

## Technical Details
- Maintained the same grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Kept accessibility features and ARIA labels
- Preserved hover effects and transitions
- Removed control buttons and activity indicators as requested
- Simplified the data loading logic for better performance

The refactored cards provide a clean, focused view of connected devices with all the essential information at a glance.
