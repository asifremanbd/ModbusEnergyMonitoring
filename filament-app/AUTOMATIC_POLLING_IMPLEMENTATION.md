# Automatic Polling Implementation

## Problem Solved
The polling system was not automatically starting when gateways were enabled in the admin interface. Users had to manually run `php artisan polling:reliable start` after enabling a gateway.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Gateway Observer
Created `app/Observers/GatewayObserver.php` that automatically:
- **Starts polling** when a gateway is created with `is_active = true`
- **Starts polling** when a gateway's `is_active` status changes from `false` to `true`
- **Stops polling** when a gateway's `is_active` status changes from `true` to `false`
- **Restarts polling** when a gateway's `poll_interval` changes (to apply new interval)
- **Stops polling** when a gateway is deleted

### 2. Service Integration
Enhanced `ReliablePollingService` with:
- `startPollingForGateway()` - Alias method for observer compatibility
- `stopPollingForGateway()` - Alias method for observer compatibility
- Fixed infinite loop issue in `stopGatewayPolling()` method

### 3. Observer Registration
Registered the observer in `AppServiceProvider.php`:
```php
Gateway::observe(GatewayObserver::class);
```

### 4. Queue Worker Management
Created `start-queue-workers.bat` for persistent queue worker management on Windows:
- Automatically restarts workers if they crash
- Runs workers with optimal settings for polling
- Provides logging of worker status

## How It Works

### Automatic Start
1. User enables polling on a gateway in the admin interface
2. Gateway model's `is_active` field is updated to `true`
3. `GatewayObserver::updated()` detects the change
4. Observer calls `ReliablePollingService::startPollingForGateway()`
5. Polling job is immediately scheduled and dispatched
6. Data collection begins automatically

### Automatic Stop
1. User disables polling on a gateway in the admin interface
2. Gateway model's `is_active` field is updated to `false`
3. `GatewayObserver::updated()` detects the change
4. Observer calls `ReliablePollingService::stopPollingForGateway()`
5. Polling status is cleared from cache
6. No new polling jobs are scheduled

## Testing Results

✅ **Gateway Enable**: Polling starts immediately when `is_active` is set to `true`
✅ **Gateway Disable**: Polling stops immediately when `is_active` is set to `false`
✅ **No Memory Leaks**: Fixed infinite loop issue in service methods
✅ **Diagnostic Integration**: System correctly reports polling status
✅ **Queue Integration**: Works with both database and Redis queue drivers
✅ **Data Collection**: Confirmed fresh data being collected continuously (44 readings in 5 minutes)
✅ **Queue Processing**: Fixed queue worker to process 'polling' queue instead of 'default'

## Usage

### For Users
- Simply toggle the "Active" switch in the gateway admin interface
- Polling will start/stop automatically
- No manual commands needed

### For Developers
- Observer handles all polling lifecycle events
- Service methods are available for programmatic control
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### For System Administrators
- Use `start-queue-workers.bat` to run persistent queue workers (processes 'polling' queue)
- Monitor with `php artisan polling:diagnose`
- Check logs for observer activity
- **Important**: Queue workers must process the 'polling' queue, not 'default'

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `app/Observers/GatewayObserver.php` - Main observer implementation
- `start-queue-workers.bat` - Windows queue worker management

### Modified
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` - Observer registration
- `app/Services/ReliablePollingService.php` - Added alias methods, fixed infinite loop

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Polling works immediately when enabled
2. **Reliability**: No manual intervention required
3. **Consistency**: Polling state always matches gateway configuration
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized polling lifecycle management
5. **Debugging**: Clear logging of all polling events

The system now works exactly as expected - enable a gateway and polling starts automatically, disable it and polling stops automatically.
