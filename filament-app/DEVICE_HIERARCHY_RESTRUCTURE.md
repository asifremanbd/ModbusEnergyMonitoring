# Device Hierarchy Restructure - Complete

## Overview
Successfully restructured the application from a flat Gateway → DataPoints structure to a hierarchical Gateway → Devices → DataPoints structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Created `devices` table** with fields:
  - `id`, `gateway_id`, `name`, `device_type`, `load_category`, `group_name`, `is_active`
- **Updated `data_points` table**:
  - Added `device_id` foreign key
  - Removed device-level fields: `device_type`, `load_category`, `custom_label`, `group_name`

### 2. Model Updates

#### New Device Model (`app/Models/Device.php`)
- Belongs to Gateway
- Has many DataPoints
- Contains device-level attributes and methods
- Includes helper methods for device type, load category, and icons

#### Updated DataPoint Model (`app/Models/DataPoint.php`)
- Now belongs to both Gateway and Device
- Removed device-level methods (moved to Device model)
- Simplified to focus on register-specific functionality

#### Updated Gateway Model (`app/Models/Gateway.php`)
- Added `devices()` relationship
- Removed virtual device fields
- Maintains existing `dataPoints()` relationship for backward compatibility

### 3. Form Structure Changes

#### GatewayResource Form
- **Before**: Single "Device Configuration" + "Registers" sections
- **After**: Nested "Devices" repeater containing:
  - Device information (name, type, category, active status)
  - Device-specific "Registers" section with repeater for DataPoints
  - Bulk actions for enabling/disabling registers per device

#### New DeviceResource
- Standalone resource for managing devices
- Form includes gateway selection, device info, and status
- Table shows devices with gateway, type, category, and register count
- Filters by gateway, device type, and active status

### 4. Key Benefits

#### Better Organization
- Clear hierarchy: Gateway → Devices → Registers
- Each device can have multiple registers
- Device-level configuration separate from register configuration

#### Improved UX
- Nested repeaters for logical grouping
- Device-specific bulk actions for registers
- Better labeling and organization in forms

#### Scalability
- Support for multiple devices per gateway
- Each device maintains its own configuration
- Easier to add device-specific features

### 5. Migration Strategy
- Created migrations for new structure
- Existing data requires manual migration due to schema changes
- Future data will follow new hierarchy automatically

### 6. Form Features

#### Device Level
- Device name, type, and load category
- Active/inactive toggle per device
- Group name for organization

#### Register Level (per device)
- Technical register labels
- Modbus function, address, data type
- Byte order and scaling configuration
- Enable/disable per register
- Bulk enable/disable actions per device

### 7. Navigation
- **Gateways**: Main gateway management with nested device/register configuration
- **Devices**: Standalone device management and overview

## Usage
1. **Create Gateway**: Set up connection parameters
2. **Add Devices**: Add one or more devices to the gateway
3. **Configure Registers**: Add registers to each device
4. **Manage**: Use bulk actions to enable/disable registers per device

## Technical Notes
- All relationships properly configured with foreign key constraints
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible
- Clean separation of concerns between gateway, device, and register levels
- Proper validation and error handling maintained
