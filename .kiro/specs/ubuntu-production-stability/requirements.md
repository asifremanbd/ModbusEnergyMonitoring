# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures the Ubuntu production environment works identically to the local Windows environment by synchronizing codebases and replacing Windows-specific functionality with Ubuntu-compatible alternatives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Ubuntu production environment configuration to match the local Windows environment, so that the identical codebase works properly on both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking environment configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure PHP settings match between Windows and Ubuntu
2. WHEN verifying dependencies THEN the system SHALL confirm all required packages are installed on Ubuntu
3. WHEN comparing .env files THEN the system SHALL identify configuration differences that affect functionality
4. WHEN assets are built THEN the system SHALL ensure CSS/JS compilation works correctly on Ubuntu

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Windows-specific features to work on Ubuntu, so that the application functions identically across both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system uses Windows-specific commands THEN it SHALL use Ubuntu-compatible alternatives
2. WHEN Windows batch files are needed THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent shell scripts for Ubuntu
3. WHEN Windows services are required THEN the system SHALL use systemd services on Ubuntu
4. WHEN file paths differ between Windows and Ubuntu THEN the system SHALL handle path differences correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all application features to work on Ubuntu production, so that buttons, menus, and functionality work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users click buttons THEN they SHALL work correctly on Ubuntu production
2. WHEN users navigate menus THEN all menu items SHALL function properly
3. WHEN JavaScript runs THEN it SHALL execute without errors on Ubuntu
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all UI components SHALL render correctly
