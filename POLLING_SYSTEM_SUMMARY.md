# Reliable Gateway Polling System - Implementation Summary

## üéØ What We Built

A comprehensive, reliable background polling system that guarantees:
- ‚úÖ Each gateway polls exactly once per configured interval
- ‚úÖ No duplicate readings or overlapping polls
- ‚úÖ Persistent workers that survive server restarts
- ‚úÖ Automatic failure detection and recovery
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail and monitoring

## üîß Key Components

### 1. ReliablePollingService (`app/Services/ReliablePollingService.php`)
- **Purpose**: Core orchestration service with duplicate prevention
- **Features**: 
  - Redis-based locking to prevent duplicate jobs
  - System-wide coordination to avoid conflicts
  - Comprehensive status tracking and validation
  - Automated cleanup of orphaned processes

### 2. Enhanced PollGatewayJob (`app/Jobs/PollGatewayJob.php`)
- **Purpose**: Individual gateway polling with self-scheduling
- **Features**:
  - Precise interval timing (no drift)
  - Automatic retry and failure handling
  - Success/failure tracking with counters
  - Self-scheduling for continuous operation

### 3. Persistent Queue Workers (Systemd Services)
- **filament-queue-worker.service**: Persistent Redis queue worker
- **filament-polling-monitor.timer**: Automated system health monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Automatic restart on failure
  - Resource limits and security hardening
  - Proper logging and monitoring

### 4. Management Commands (`app/Console/Commands/ReliablePollingCommand.php`)
- **Purpose**: Complete system control and monitoring
- **Commands**:
  - `polling:reliable start` - Start system or specific gateway
  - `polling:reliable stop` - Stop system or specific gateway  
  - `polling:reliable status` - Show detailed system status
  - `polling:reliable audit` - Clean up orphaned processes
  - `polling:reliable validate` - Check system integrity

### 5. Health Check API (`app/Http/Controllers/PollingHealthController.php`)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/polling/health` - Quick health check
  - `GET /api/polling/status` - Detailed system status
  - `POST /api/polling/audit` - Trigger cleanup

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Audit Existing System
```bash
sudo ./audit-and-cleanup-polling.sh
```
This script identifies and helps remove:
- Manual queue workers
- Cron job entries  
- Background scripts
- Failed job queues
- Orphaned processes

### 2. Setup Reliable System
```bash
sudo ./setup-reliable-polling.sh
```
This script:
- Installs systemd service files
- Starts persistent queue workers
- Configures monitoring timer
- Initializes the polling system

### 3. Verify Operation
```bash
php artisan polling:reliable status --detailed
```

## üîç How It Prevents Duplicates

### System-Level Protection
1. **System Lock**: Only one instance of the polling system can start at a time
2. **Gateway Locks**: Each gateway has a Redis lock preventing duplicate jobs
3. **Status Tracking**: Redis cache tracks active polling state per gateway
4. **Queue Separation**: Dedicated Redis queues for different job types

### Timing Precision
1. **Self-Scheduling**: Each job schedules its own next execution
2. **Interval Enforcement**: Jobs only start if previous interval has elapsed
3. **Cache Validation**: Status cache prevents premature job dispatch
4. **Lock TTL**: Automatic lock expiration prevents deadlocks

### Failure Recovery
1. **Health Monitoring**: Automated checks every 5-10 minutes
2. **Orphan Cleanup**: Removes stale locks and status entries
3. **Integrity Validation**: Ensures all active gateways have polling scheduled
4. **Automatic Restart**: Systemd services restart workers on failure

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# System status
php artisan polling:reliable status

# Service health
systemctl status filament-queue-worker
systemctl status filament-polling-monitor.timer

# Live logs
journalctl -u filament-queue-worker -f
```

### Health Check Endpoints
- `http://your-server/api/polling/health` - JSON health status
- `http://your-server/api/polling/status` - Detailed system info

### Automated Maintenance
- **Every 5 minutes**: Integrity validation
- **Every 10 minutes**: System audit and cleanup
- **On failure**: Automatic worker restart
- **On boot**: Automatic system startup

## üîí Security & Performance

### Security Features
- Workers run as `www-data` with minimal privileges
- Service hardening (NoNewPrivileges, PrivateTmp, etc.)
- Redis access limited to localhost
- Proper file permissions throughout

### Performance Optimizations
- Dedicated Redis queues with priority
- Configurable worker parameters
- Memory limits and automatic restarts
- Efficient Redis key management

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Queue workers not processing jobs:**
```bash
systemctl restart filament-queue-worker
redis-cli ping  # Check Redis connectivity
```

**Gateways not polling:**
```bash
php artisan polling:reliable validate
php artisan polling:reliable audit
```

**Duplicate readings:**
```bash
sudo ./audit-and-cleanup-polling.sh
php artisan polling:reliable stop
php artisan polling:reliable start
```

**High memory usage:**
```bash
systemctl restart filament-queue-worker
```

### Emergency Reset
```bash
# Stop everything
systemctl stop filament-queue-worker filament-polling-monitor.timer
php artisan polling:reliable stop
redis-cli flushdb

# Restart clean
systemctl start filament-queue-worker filament-polling-monitor.timer
php artisan polling:reliable start
```

## üìà Benefits Achieved
